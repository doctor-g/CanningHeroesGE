This is a reimplementation of [Canning Heroes](https://github.com/HappyAccidentStudio/CanningHeroes/),
which was developed by a multidisciplinary undergraduate team at 
[Ball State University](https://bsu.edu), working with [Minnetrista](http://minnetrista.net),
as part of an [immersive learning](https://bsu.edu/immersive) project in Spring&nbsp;2019.
The original release was developed exclusively for installation on a digital table 
in [the Oakhurst home at Minnetrista](https://minnetrista.net/home/things-to-do/exhibits/the-oakhurst-experience/) and can be found [on itch.io](https://doctor-g.itch.io/canning-heroes).


## Building

This project was built using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) using
a project organization inspired by [GDQuest's Best Practices for GDScript 
recommendations](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/best-practices/godot-gdscript/).
[The build script](build.sh) can be used to build the HTML5 target from
the Linux command line and also increment the build number;
[the deploy script] will build the target using the build script and push the result
to GitHub Pages.
